# Optimization examples

## Python notebooks

This repository features various notebooks which show how to solve optimization
problems with [Opvious](https://www.opvious.io). In particular, they highlight
how to use the [Python SDK][] and integrate with various data sources. Most can
be run directly from your browser, for example:

+ [Group expenses](https://www.opvious.io/notebooks/retro/examples?path=group-expenses.ipynb)
+ [Sudoku](https://www.opvious.io/notebooks/retro/examples?path=sudoku.ipynb)
+ [Product allocation](https://www.opvious.io/notebooks/retro/examples?path=product-allocation.ipynb)

Each notebook can also be run locally. This repo contains a convenience script
to start a [Jupyter][] notebook server in a virtualenv with all required
dependencies:

```sh
./scripts/start-server.sh
```
