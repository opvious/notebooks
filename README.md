# Optimization notebooks

This repository contains notebooks solving optimization problems with [Opvious'
Python SDK][].

Most can be run directly from your browser, for example:

+ [Group expenses](https://www.opvious.io/notebooks/retro/examples?path=group-expenses.ipynb)
+ [Sudoku](https://www.opvious.io/notebooks/retro/examples?path=sudoku.ipynb)
+ [Product allocation](https://www.opvious.io/notebooks/retro/examples?path=product-allocation.ipynb)

Notebooks can also be run locally. This repo contains a convenience script to
start a [Jupyter][] notebook server in a virtualenv with all required
dependencies:

```sh
./scripts/start-server.sh
```
