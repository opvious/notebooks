    "# Using a self-hosted API server\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we go over the steps required to set up and connect to a self-hosted [API server](https://hub.docker.com/r/opvious/api-server), allowing you to host your own Opvious platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting the server\n",
    "\n",
    "### With the CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to download and run the API server is with the [Opvious CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opvious-cli#starting-an-api-server). The CLI will take care of setting up the server's dependencies automatically before starting it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "npm install -g opvious-cli # Install the CLI\n",
    "opvious api start # Start the API server along with its dependencies\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the CLI's README or run `opvious api --help` to view the list of available commands. You may also be interested in the server's telemetry configuration options described [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/opvious/api-server).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### From the Docker image\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can download and run the [`opvious/api-server`](https://hub.docker.com/r/opvious/api-server) Docker image directly. This allows you to use it with your own database and/or cache:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run -p 8080:8080 \\\n",
    "  -e DB_URL=postgres:// \\\n",
    "  -e REDIS_URL=redis:// \\\n",
    "  -e OPVIOUS_API_IMAGE_EULA \\\n",
    "  opvious/api-server\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the image's documentation for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting to the server\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the API server is running, the next step is to use it from the SDKs. To do so, simply set the `OPVIOUS_ENDPOINT` environment variable to the server's endpoint (http://localhost:8080 if started via the CLI with default options). For example from your Bash configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# ~/.bashrc\n",
    "OPVIOUS_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also find it useful to create a [dedicated configuration profile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opvious-cli#configuration-profiles) pointing to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# ~/.config/opvious/cli.yml\n",
    "profiles:\n",
    "  - name: local\n",
    "    endpoint: http://localhost:8080\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Authenticating requests\n",
    "\n",
    "The server's `STATIC_TOKENS` environment variable is used to specify a comma-separated list of static API tokens for authenticating API requests. Each entry's format is `<email>=<token>`, where `<email>` is the associated account's email. When using the CLI, this variable is set with the `-t` option:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "opvious api start -t user@example.com=secret-token\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These tokens can then be used as regular API tokens in SDKs by prefixing them with `static:`. For example requests to the server started with the command just above can be authenticated as `user@example.com` by setting `OPVIOUS_TOKEN=static:secret-token`."
