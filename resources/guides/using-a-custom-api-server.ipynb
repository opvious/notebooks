        "You can use any API server's endpoint instead of the default Opvious cloud for all SDKs by setting the `OPVIOUS_ENDPOINT` environment variable accordingly, here http://localhost:8080. Consider also creating an [alternate configuration profile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opvious-cli#configuration-profiles) pointing to it.\n",

        "\n",
        "The server's `STATIC_TOKENS` environment variable is used to specify a comma-separated list of static API tokens for authenticating API requests. Each entry's format is `<email>=<token>`, where `<email>` is the associated account's email. These tokens can then be used as regular API tokens in SDKs by prefixing them with `static:`. For example requests to a server configured with `STATIC_TOKENS=admin@example.com=secret` can be authenticated as `admin@example.com` by setting `OPVIOUS_TOKEN=static:secret`."
